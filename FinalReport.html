    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      This architecture is designed for an e-commerce platform specializing in
      online food ordering services, focusing on efficient user interaction
      management, order processing, and payment handling. While the "Skip the
      Lines" application serves as a practical example, the concepts presented
      are broadly applicable to any microservices-based system.
      The architecture is engineered to support between 1,000 and 10,000
      requests per second (RPS) per data center. It employs a microservices
      approach, where each service is dedicated to specific functionalities,
      allowing for scalable and independent deployment. This design enhances
      scalability, maintainability, and agility while facilitating effective
      fault isolation.
