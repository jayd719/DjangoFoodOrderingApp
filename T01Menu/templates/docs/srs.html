  <h1>Software Design Specification</h1>
  <!-- SECTION ONE -->
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This architecture is designed for an e-commerce platform specializing in
    online food ordering services, focusing on efficient user interaction
    management, order processing, and payment handling. While the "Skip the
    Lines" application serves as a practical example, the concepts presented are
    broadly applicable to any microservices-based system. The architecture is
    engineered to support between 1,000 and 10,000 requests per second (RPS) per
    data center. It employs a microservices approach, where each service is
    dedicated to specific functionalities, allowing for scalable and independent
    deployment. This design enhances scalability, maintainability, and agility
    while facilitating effective fault isolation.
