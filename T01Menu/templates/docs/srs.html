  <h2>1. <strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
  <h3>1.1 <strong>Purpose</strong></h3>
  <p>
    This document provides a detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
    for the <strong>Skip The Line</strong> platform, which is designed to
    provide online order-taking services to restaurants and catering companies
    at high-footfall live events such as fairs, stadiums, and other large
    venues. The purpose of this document is to define the functionalities,
    performance, design constraints, and external interfaces required for the
    development and deployment of the platform.
  </p>
  <h3>1.2 <strong>Scope</strong></h3>
  <p>
    The <strong>Convince Matters</strong> platform will enable event attendees
    to order food and beverages directly from their seats via a mobile
    application. Vendors will receive and manage these orders through a
    dedicated backend system. The platform will be used by event venues, food
    vendors, and event attendees to streamline the food ordering process during
    events. The scope of this SRS includes functional requirements,
    non-functional requirements, and design constraints.
